# Reliability-engineering-with-fiabilipy-
Create components with fiabilipy module and add markov decission process for reliability curve 
This files will explain reliability of components (electronics) at different running hours 
users can check the availability @ 150 hrs and etc and compare the same with graphical representation in matplot 
also markov decision process is tried to explain the 4 states of coponent availability say normal,damage,available,faulty
